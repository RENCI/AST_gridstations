The "interpolation_stationlist" data are intended for use by pipelines that perform interpolations such as ADDA. 
These lists may be shorter than those found in the "full_stationlist" and may, conceivably, be slightly different lists.
Conversely, some lists may be the same as its counterpart in the "interpolation_stationlist" data set.
The HSOFS, EC95D, Region3 grids currently have land and water control nodes included. The remaining grids are TBD.
These are the new control points which will never be KNN optimized and and intended for use with the new LinearRBF methods
