The "full_stationlist" data are not intended for use by pipelines that perform interpolations such as ADDA. These are longer lists of

includes stations from the Caribbean Sea to benefit broader overall situational awareness in the APSVIZ2 displays.

As such, for the "full_stationlist", no land or water control node files are present for emphasis
